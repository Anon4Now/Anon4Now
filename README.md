# Dan here!

##### Little About Me:
I am a security professional with interests in scripting, web development, pen-testing, and mostly all things IT/IT-Security related. My current favorite scripting languages to write in are [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/), [Splunk SPL](https://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:SPL), and [Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/).

A couple of goals for 2022:
* Contribute to open-source projects
* Design and deploy a personal website from scratch
* Learn more about database schemas and administration
* Contribute to the security community through tools, connections, and research
* Potentially start learning GoLang
